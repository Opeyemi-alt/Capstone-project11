# Capstone-project(2)
This is where My Second Capstone project are documented  while learning Data Analysis with the Incubator Hub


### Project Title:
---
Customer Segmentation for Subscription Service


### Project Objective:
---
To design and develop a comprehensive customer segmentation and subscription analytics model using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, enabling data-driven insights into customer behavior, subscription trends, and retention strategies for a subscription service.


### Project Scope:
---
1. Data Collection: Extract customer data, subscription history, payment transactions, and cancellation/renewal records from the subscription service's database using SQL.

2. Segment Identification: Analyze customer demographics, behavior, and subscription patterns to identify distinct segments, including:

    - High-value customers
    - Churn-prone customers
    - Inactive customers
    - New customers

3. Trend Analysis: Examine subscription trends, including:

    - Subscription type (monthly, annually, etc.)
    - Cancellation rates
    - Renewal rates
    - Upgrade/downgrade patterns

4. Customer Behavior Analysis: Investigate customer behavior, including:

    - Engagement metrics (login frequency, feature usage)
    - Payment history (timeliness, method)
    - Support requests and feedback

5. Data Visualization: Create interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize customer segments, subscription trends, and behavior.


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
---
1. Customer Retention Rate

2. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)


### Data Sources:
---
1. Customer Database (SQL)

2. Subscription History Database (SQL)

3. Payment Transaction Database (SQL)


### Tools and Technologies:
